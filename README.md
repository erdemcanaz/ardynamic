# ardynamic
When working on a prototype, we upload a code to Arduino, test it, improve it, and upload the improved code repeatedly. It is a bit annoying. This is the reason why the “ardynamic” came up. By sending serial commands to Arduino, you may manipulate ports, get read values, code hardware or software PWMs or even set variables (int(#50) and string(#10,&lt;length 50). This library also allows us to control arduino using any programing language with a serial library. It means you can control Arduino using RaspberryPi. Arduino becomes nothing but a tool to implement your complicated algorithms executed on raspberry. The main concept of ardynamic is we use virtual registers* for variables, pin states, etc., and an algorithm that updates those registers according to serial data. To sum up, “ardynamic” allows us to program Arduino dynamically over serial communication.
